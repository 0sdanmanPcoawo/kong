Vivado is a design suite from Xilinx that allows you to design, verify and optimize FPGA and Zynq SoC projects. To use Vivado, you need a license that authorizes you to access the features and tools of the software. There are different types of licenses available, depending on your needs and preferences. In this article, we will explain how to obtain and manage a Vivado license using the Vivado License Manager (VLM).
 
## Types of Vivado Licenses
 
There are two main types of Vivado licenses: free or evaluation licenses and purchased licenses. Free or evaluation licenses are provided by Xilinx for certain products or features that you can use for a limited time or with some restrictions. Purchased licenses are obtained by buying Vivado products or IP cores from Xilinx or its partners. Purchased licenses can be either node-locked or floating. A node-locked license is tied to a specific computer or device, while a floating license can be shared among multiple users on a network.

## How to Obtain a Vivado License
 
To obtain a Vivado license, you need to follow these steps:
 
1. Install Vivado on your computer or device. You can download Vivado from the [Xilinx Download Center](https://www.xilinx.com/support/download.html). After completing the installation, the VLM will start automatically and guide you through the licensing process.
2. Choose the type of license you want to obtain. You can select from the following options:
    - Get Free ISE WebPACK, ISE/Vivado IP or SDK License: This option allows you to obtain a free license for certain products or features that are included in the ISE WebPACK Edition, the ISE/Vivado IP Edition or the SDK Edition of Vivado.
    - Connect to Xilinx.com and Acquire License: This option allows you to obtain a purchased license for Vivado products or IP cores that you have bought from Xilinx or its partners. You need to have a Xilinx account and an internet connection for this option.
    - Redeem Product Voucher: This option allows you to obtain a purchased license for Vivado products or IP cores that are included in some Xilinx or partner board kits. You need to have a product voucher code that comes with the board kit for this option.
    - Load License File: This option allows you to load a license file that you have obtained from another source, such as an email attachment or a USB drive.
3. Follow the instructions on the screen to complete the licensing process. Depending on the type of license you choose, you may need to provide some information, such as your Xilinx account credentials, your host ID, your voucher code or your license file location.
